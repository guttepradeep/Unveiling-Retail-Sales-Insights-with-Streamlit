**# Unveiling-Retail-Sales-Insights-with-Streamlit
I performed an in-depth statistical analysis of sales data to uncover trends and insights. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and SciPy, I explored various descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation for product sales.

In this project:

Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing were conducted to analyze the significance of sales performance.

Dynamic visualizations were created to explore sales distribution, category performance, and trends.

Key Highlights:

Descriptive statistics analysis.

Hypothesis testing to compare mean sales.

Visualizations using Streamlit for interactive exploration.**
